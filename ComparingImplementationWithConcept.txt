Comparing this implementation with the concept developed in Project #3.
_________________________________________________________________________

1) Does this project fully implement its concept? Was the original concept practical?

	- The client GUI was not implemented as mentioned in the operational concept document.
	- Different channels were created for messages and files.
	- This project nearly implements 90% of the concept that was developed in Project 3.

2) Were there things you learned during the implementation that made the origninal concept less relevant or incomplete?
	- Understood the concept of single endpoints for each server rather than multiple endpoints.
